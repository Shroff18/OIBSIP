                <p>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who
                    participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be
                    retaliation
                    for the death of an Indian nationalist.He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the
                    Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic
                    coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after
                    his
                    execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.Borrowing ideas from
                    Bolshevism
                    and anarchism,he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent
                    introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign
                    for
                    India's independence. </p>
